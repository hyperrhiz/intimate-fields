<h4>Margaret Simon</h4>
<p>Margaret Simon is Assistant Professor of English at North Carolina State University, where she focuses on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature, material cultures, history of the emotions, and the history and literary representation of early modern writing practices. She received her PhD from the University of Virginia and subsequently taught early modern literature and book history in the English department and the interdisciplinary History of Text Technologies program at Florida State University. She joined NC State’s English department as an assistant professor in 2013.</p>

<p>Dr. Simon’s most recent research concerns materiality and comparative media studies, looking to how early modern printed texts rendered objects in language and graphic technologies, as well as their resonance with today’s digital, and particularly three-dimensional, archives. In pursuing these relations, Dr. Simon also works across a range of scholarly communications formats, from print to digital to fabricated forms. At NC State, Dr. Simon teaches courses including early modern literature, women’s writing, and the contemporary graphic novel.</p>
