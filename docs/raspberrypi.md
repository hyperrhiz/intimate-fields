### Raspberry Pi

#### An alternative configuration for Raspberry Pi

The purpose of this hardware setup is to provide a "live" version of the box that remixes posies on demand when the NFC tags are scanned by the reader, and posts them to Twitter.

Because this setup requires some configuration when setting up the Pi in each location, it's not "plug and play" in the same way that the Arduino version is, so it's not so good for travelling with, and requires a net collection to post to Twitter rather than having the feed run independently. More details coming soon on building this flavor of *Intimate Fields*.

For ELO2017, we used the [Arduino version](arduino.html), for ease of travel and minimal configuration. We recommend the Arduino version for classroom use.
